For the final project, I will do the project by using the Arduino with an I2C temperature sensor and a shift register to create a temperature sensor LED bar graph display. When the temperature goes up, the led light will all light up, and when it cools down, then led light will off based on how the temperature is. This project gives a visual representation of the change of temperature.
Supply:
Arduino, temperature sensor,shift register
